== SQL Commands edited for Covid Tableau project (MySQL Workbench)
== Dataset have been downloaded and adjusted from    

https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths


1.
Select SUM(new_cases) as total_cases, SUM(cast(new_deaths as DECIMAL)) as total_deaths, SUM(cast(new_deaths as DECIMAL))/SUM(New_Cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
From CovidDeaths
where continent is not null 
order by 1,2

2. EDITED 

SELECT location,MAX(cast(Total_Deaths as DECIMAL)) as TotalDeathCount
FROM CovidDeaths
GROUP BY location 
ORDER BY TotalDeathCount DESC

3.
Select Location, Population, MAX(total_cases) as HighestInfectionCount,  Max((total_cases/population))*100 as PercentPopulationInfected
From CovidDeaths
Group by Location, Population
order by PercentPopulationInfected desc

4.

Select Location, Population,date, MAX(total_cases) as HighestInfectionCount,  Max((total_cases/population))*100 as PercentPopulationInfected
From CovidDeaths
Group by Location, Population, date
order by PercentPopulationInfected desc
